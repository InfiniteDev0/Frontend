                                        [World Wide Web]  
     WWW , therefore Wan became the internet.

     * THE WEB --- is a way to acces info using the internet   
     * Web pages --- where the info is deplayed
     * Web servers --- 
                      stores web pages and are connected to the internet
     * Web browser --- display webpages using protocols
                     the most porpulat protocal is Hyper Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

     * Website --- a collection of web pages.
     * Static web pages --- 
                          designer of web pages content is being shared to all users and is static every user sees the same thing. 


                          -----------Note----------  

     * Static web pages are built using Html and are styled using Css and are made to handle user 
       logic using Javascript , frameworks like nextjs and frontend libraries like react js can also be used bcz the combine html and js in a jsx or tsx file and use css in index.css file or tailwind css dependedency which uses inline styling of code.

     * the also have a backend to handle logic and stores and get and delete and update data from 
       the database but we will do it this in web-backend for here we will only do the user part a.k.a Ui (user interface) what the user sees. 
         
     * we will do plain html then style it with css then add logic with js
